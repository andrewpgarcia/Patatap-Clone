# Patatap-Clone
This is a clone of Patatap from Colt Steele's course. My code differs from his original code in that I had to update to the new version of howler for the project to work in chrome. Also it throws CORS errors if you don't run it from an HTTP server, but it does still work if you run it straight from the folder it's in on your drive

All you need to do to get it to run is download all the files here and then left click on index.html and run it in your preferred browser(Chrome Recommended)
The app responds to QWERTY keypresses on your keyboard
